__Jacob Trombetta__ is a multi-media artist, bringing novel applications of technology to bear in artistic spaces.

Haunted by ambient goth soundscapes and an eye for the shadows, he crafts evocative musical textures and code-manipulated video art.
        
With the pedal steel as a focal point, Trombetta brings compositional expertise and a background spanning robotics, computer vision, and cryptography to produce uniquely atmospheric experiences.
        
If you like ambient electro-acoustic music made by an Appalachian man, you are in the right place.
