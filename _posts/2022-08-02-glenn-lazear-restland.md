RESTLAND was written by Jacob Trombetta, Robert Ethington, and Friday Mike Wilkinson.

RESTLAND was inspired by a cemetery in Kent, Ohio. The album was recorded between 2019-2022 at the Discrete Spectrum Studio in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. Lockdown forced the album to be completed in isolation. RESTLAND is Glenn Lazearâ€™s McCartney solo album era album made in suburbia. The album tried to mix the sounds of jangle pop with post punk guitar inspiration.
