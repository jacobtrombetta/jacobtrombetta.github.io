</div>

*Patient Afternoon* opens with a hypnotic piece interweaving lap steel guitar, voice and electronics, written and performed by Jacob Trombetta. The second track introduces a haunting processed saxophone performed by Jennifer Howell along with Trombetta's varied instrumentation. The final piece, “You Are Lightning”, is an evocative meditation for solo guitar.

*Patient Afternoon* is the second full length album from Ondelette. Recorded at the Discrete Spectrum Sound Studios in 2012.
