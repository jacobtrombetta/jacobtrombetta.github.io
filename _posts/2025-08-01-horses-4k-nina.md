"NINA, the debut work of Horses 4K, is an electronic album with Americana as its source material. The duo of Jacob Trombetta and Robin Guiler feed pedal steel guitar into samplers and synthesizers, taking a distinctive instrument and manipulating it into something sometimes unrecognisable and otherworldly." - [The Quietus](https://thequietus.com/quietus-reviews/horses-4k-nina-review/)

NINA is the first installment of the six-part Hickory Hills Cycle and serves as an entry point to Horses 4k's pastoral sound-world. NINA’s tracks are excerpts from long form improvisations, edited into miniature forms. NINA’s track titles are drawn from interviews with the titular horse's owner.

A little more about NINA: 14.1 hands; 15 years old; barely a horse, mostly a pony.

Robin Guiler - electronics and synthesizer  
Jacob Trombetta - pedal steel guitar and electronics

Recorded at Trombetta's house 2024-2025  
Produced, mixed, and mastered by Horses 4k
