"Within an ecosystem dominated by algorithms and artificial simulations of the past, it is remarkable — almost unfathomable —to experience modern improvisational music that uses only human virtuosity as its guiding creative principle. If LOST LANGUAGES had been recorded 100 times, there would be 100 different versions. Yet all 100 would share the same core qualities: understated complexity, a fusion of contradictory fusions, and the increasingly rare sensation of jazz as a surrogate for the machinations of the untethered mind." - Chuck Klosterman
